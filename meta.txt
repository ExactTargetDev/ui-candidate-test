NOTE: I have been asked by Experis to submit what I have even though there are portions of this project I am in the process of completing. I have followed the instructions as best as I could, however, they (Experis) are concerned it is taking too long to complete (taking into consideration my own client work outside of this test with which I have spent as much time as I could putting time into this, as my future employment is just as important to me, and the long-term possibilities sufficiently more important) and with timeliness as a concern, I submit this project with the User Interface "Dashboard" highly incomplete (There are functional components along with styles that do not exist as my time on this has been cut short). I regret to not have had the chance to finish the UI portion of this test, and I do hope that with what is there that enough information about my style can be extrapolated for a decent evaluation. Thank you!
