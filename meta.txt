comment: 
I have implemented all the requirement mentioned in the README, since I 
don't have photoshop, I'm not able to extract css and layer from the psd, 
I used bootstrap ui and jQuery to replicate the psd. That's the reason 
I took so much time to complete the task, I plan to use bower to instll 
the external libraries and other denpendencies, but due to the timelimitation, 
I just includeded the libraries and css in the js and css folder. Thanks
for your understanding.
