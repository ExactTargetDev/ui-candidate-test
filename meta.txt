Total Time: (all times approximate)

    Javascript functions: 2.5 hours
    Javascript test file: 1 hours

    JsAndDom.html: 1.25 hours

    Building Screenshot.html: Probably a little more than 7 hours, although
      I didn't really keep close track of time for that file specifically.


Browser Testing:

	With Mac:

	- Chrome version 26.0.1410.65
	- Firefox version 12.0
	- Safari version 6.0.3

	With Windows (via browserstack.com)

	- IE 9 on Windows 7
	- IE 10 on Windows 8


Why I chose these browsers:

	They're pretty much the latest and greatest as far as browsers go.  I did
	not include IE 8 because it does not support console logging, which would
	not support writing console messages for the assigned tasks.


UnitTest:

	Used the QUnit testing included with the test.
