A few notes:
So I think I might have misunderstood some items at first... I was attempting to put together the dashboard as well, but I do not
have Photoshop. I do have Gimp, and was attempting to use that, but I don't have much experience with it, so I apologize if I 
have an automatic failure from not completing the slicing into HTML portion. 
I do feel comfortable enough with HTML and CSS to model objects around, I just don't know my way around Photoshop.
I also probably spent way too much time trying to open different emulators to test IE and mobile, but I figured I would
try to make up for my lack of Photoshop skills with being thorough. 
Anyway, thank you for your time!
